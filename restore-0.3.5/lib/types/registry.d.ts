/**
 * Pet registry — the multi-pet contract. One pet is a directory holding a
 * 'pet.json' manifest plus an atlas image; nothing else is required, and no
 * host or client code changes when a pet is added. The registry scans four
 * sources, later sources overriding earlier ones on an id collision:
 *
 *   1. the package's own 'assets' subdirectories (built-in pets);
 *   2. '${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/pets' subdirectories (hatch-pet custom pets,
 *      legacy source kept readable);
 *   3. '$DSH_HOME/pets' subdirectories (the pet-center user directory);
 *   4. 'PetConfig.pets' manifests composed by the embedding application
 *      (highest precedence).
 *
 * Manifests are parsed through manifest-v2 (pet-center M2, issue #623): v1
 * manifests are compat-read as sprite2d, v2 manifests validate fail-closed,
 * and structured diagnostics ride alongside the legacy warnings. Live2d
 * entries (pet-center M3) list like any other pet: the entry carries the
 * validated live2d block plus the model's reference closure (the servable
 * set the asset route allows), and a model3.json that is unreadable or
 * declares unsafe references rejects the entry with an error diagnostic.
 *
 * The manifest follows the Codex/hatch-pet contract (8 columns x 9 rows of
 * 192x208 cells, the 9-state row order below). Legacy whale-girl manifests
 * that only carry 'frames' keep working: geometry, per-row frame counts and
 * per-track rhythm all fall back to the hatch-pet contract defaults, and the
 * whale-girl manifest overrides its own durations.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-pet/registry
