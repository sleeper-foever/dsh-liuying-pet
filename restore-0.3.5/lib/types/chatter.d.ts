/**
 * Pet chatter — the pet's voice while sessions work. Two speakers live here:
 *
 *  1. The status voice (session bubbles): big per-scene copy pools instead of
 *     one fixed line per phase, a fine-grained tool-name → copy-family map,
 *     and a compact real-argument hint ('跑跑 npm test'), in the spirit of
 *     the working-activity plugin's status line. Lines rotate round-robin —
 *     while a phase persists the copy advances every few seconds, so the pet
 *     feels alive without flickering per streamed chunk.
 *  2. The murmur engine (碎碎念): the pet's inner whispers — category
 *     lines woken by the SITUATION (thinking / writing / the running tool
 *     family), plus outcome lines woken only by structured session results
 *     (test green, tool errors, turn completion). The model's own prose is
 *     never read, and no whisper ever quotes real content. Cooldowns keep
 *     whispers occasional.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: round-robin everywhere (no Math.random), clocks are
 * injected. The first line of each status pool is the legacy fixed copy the
 * plugin has always shown, so existing installs keep their wording until the
 * scene cycles. No emoji anywhere (repository rule); ～ is the whale-girl's
 * signature.
 *
 * Since pet-center M4 (issue #677) every pool is overridable through a
 * {@link VoicePoolsProvider}: the built-in pools are the fallback layer, and
 * voice packs (per-pet voice.json / the global .voice.json) layer their
 * pools on top at draw time.
