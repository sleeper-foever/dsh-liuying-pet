/**
 * Voice-pack normalization and merge (pet-center M4, issue #677).
 *
 * A voice pack is the optional 'voice.json' inside a pet directory, or the
 * global '$DSH_HOME/pets/.voice.json' override file — pure JSON content that
 * layers pet copy over the built-in pools. Two halves:
 *
 *  - 'overrides': the chatter pools (status / tools / toolRemaining /
 *    whispers) handed to the chatter engines through a VoicePoolsProvider;
 *  - 'panel': the hover-panel chrome (button labels, stat formats, action
 *    subset) served to the browser half through PetDefinition.panel.
 *
 * Discipline split matches the registry: STRUCTURE is fail-closed per file
 * (a non-object root drops the whole pack with a warning), CONTENT is
 * warn-and-drop per slot — one bad line never breaks a pet. The JSON Schema
 * twin lives at contracts/voice-pack-v1.schema.json for documentation and
 * external tooling; this hand-rolled normalizer is authoritative (the
 * repository ships no schema-validator runtime).
 *
 * Placeholder policy (each pool kind whitelists its own tokens):
 *  - status / whisper pools / panel labels: no placeholders allowed — a line
 *    carrying any '{...}' token is dropped with a warning;
 *  - tools: {tool} and {hint}; toolRemaining: {n}; panel stats:
 *    {rank} / {n} / {points}.
 *
 * This file is imported directly by scripts/dsh-pet under node's strip-only
 * TypeScript mode: keep it erasable-syntax-only.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-pet/voice-pack
