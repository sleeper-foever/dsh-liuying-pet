/**
 * Global floating pet entry. The pet is host-global (its state, display and
 * interactions live on '/api/pet/*' endpoints with no session dimension), so
 * it must not ride a session-scoped slot — on the new-conversation screen no
 * session exists to scope a slot by, and the pet would vanish (issue #48).
 * The client half therefore mounts this entry straight onto 'document.body'
 * (see index.ts): while visible it renders the floating PetSprite (a
 * portal), while hidden it renders a fixed-position summon button. Which
 * sprite renders is decided by the host snapshot's pet id resolved against
 * the registry list — no per-pet component exists.
