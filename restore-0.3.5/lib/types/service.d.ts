/**
 * Pet host service — the `pet.*` RPC domain. A composition facade: it wires
 * the pure event projection (`event-projection`) onto the state machine,
 * delegates the affinity economy to the ledger (`ledger`), and routes
 * persistence through `persist`. The API gateway maps these methods onto
 * `pet.state` / `pet.pets` / `pet.interact` / `pet.setVisible` /
 * `pet.setConfig` / `pet.setName` / `pet.setPet` for browser consumers.
 *
 * Concurrent sessions each keep their own machine: the sprite animation
 * follows the most recent meaningful event (the display session) while the
 * state view carries one bubble per active session.
