/**
 * Official session event projection — pure. Maps the durable DSH session
 * vocabulary onto the pet's visual phases and carries an optional completed-
 * turn reward for the ledger. Holds no state of its own; callers keep a
 * {@link ProjectionRuntime} per session and feed events in arrival order.
 *
 * Status copy comes from the chatter voice (big rotating pools, per-tool
 * families, real-argument hints), and the projection feeds the murmur engine
 * (碎碎念) with the SITUATION — thinking/writing during the stream, the
 * running tool family on tool calls, and the STRUCTURED outcome on
 * tool/result and turn/end — so the pet's inner voice always roughly knows
 * what is going on and never mis-fires on output text. The wall clock is
 * injected by the caller, keeping every projection reproducible.
 * @module @linxin666/dsh-pet/event-projection
